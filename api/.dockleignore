# Dockle ignore rules for Phentrieve API container
# See: https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle#ignore-rules

# CIS-DI-0001: Create a user for the container
# REASON: The entrypoint starts as root to fix volume permissions, then drops to
# non-root user (phentrieve:10001) using gosu before running the application.
# This follows Docker best practices for handling bind mount permissions.

# DKL-DI-0006: Do not store credential in environment variables/files
# REASON: False positives from third-party library files:
# - opt/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mcp/server/auth/settings.py (MCP library)
# - opt/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/scipy/_lib/cobyqa/settings.py (SciPy library)
# These are library configuration files, not credential storage.
