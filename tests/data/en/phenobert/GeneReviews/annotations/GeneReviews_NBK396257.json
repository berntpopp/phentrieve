  "full_text": "Summary:\nCLPB (caseinolytic peptidase B) deficiency is characterized by neurologic involvement and neutropenia, which range from severe to mild. To date, a total of 26 individuals from 16 families have been reported.\nDescription:\nThe disease spectrum of CLPB deficiency ranges from severe to moderate to mild as determined by neurologic involvement and neutropenia. Children with neonatal onset or early-infantile onset have severe involvement and may die from complications of their disease, whereas those with late-infantile and early-childhood onset have a milder clinical presentation [Wortmann et al, unpublished data].\nWhile many, but not all, individuals with CLPB deficiency have bilateral congenital or infantile cataracts, their presence is not associated with the severity of the neurologic involvement or neutropenia.\nAlthough no typical dysmorphic features have been reported, secondary dysmorphic features due to muscle involvement and movement disorder can be seen.\nTo date a total of 26 individuals from 16 families with CLPB deficiency have been reported in the literature (n=14). Most have been identified as neonates; all were symptomatic by early childhood.\n",
