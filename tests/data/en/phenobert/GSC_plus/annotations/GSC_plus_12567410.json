  "full_text": "CDMP-1, a cartilage-specific member of the TGFss superfamily of secreted signaling molecules, plays a key role in chondrogenesis, growth and patterning of the developing vertebrate skeleton. Homozygous CDMP-1 mutations cause Hunter-Thompson and Grebe types of acromesomelic chondrodysplasia and DuPan syndrome in humans, as well as brachypodism in mice, while heterozygous mutations cause brachydactyly type C (BDC). We present clinical and radiographic data from three unrelated families in which 12 members share the same heterozygous CDMP-1 mutation, an insertion (insG206), resulting in a frameshift predicted to cause functional haploinsufficiency. Although eight mutation carriers display BDC, four have normal hands and feet, confirming nonpenetrance of BDC with CDMP-1 mutations. In addition, several carriers have other skeletal abnormalities, including severe bilateral vertical talus (in two), developmental hip dysplasia (in one), and short stature (in two, who are otherwise unaffected). Premature vertebral end-plate disease was observed in four mutation carriers and was associated with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in three of these. Axial skeletal involvement has not been previously reported in association with CDMP-1 mutations. This finding is consistent with CDMP-1 expression in human hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are present in the ring epiphyses of vertebral end plates. Phenotypic variation in BDC has previously been attributed either to locus heterogeneity or to the varied functional effects of different CDMP-1 mutations. The remarkable range of phenotypes caused by this identical CDMP-1 mutation in these families emphasizes the crucial role of genetic background, stochastic variation and/or environmental factors in modifying the observed phenotype. Our findings illustrate that nonpenetrance for the typical features of BDC can be appreciable and that atypical skeletal features that have been reported in some patients with BDC (i.e., clubfoot, short stature, spondylolysis) may also result from CDMP-1 mutation.",
