  "full_text": "We report on a 32-year-old Italian man, his 5-year-old daughter, and his 3 1/2-year-old son, all of whom had congenital joint contractures. Each has severe ulnar deviation of fingers and soft-tissue contractures of both hands; and each had bilateral clubfeet at birth. The father is short in stature, as are the children, who also have delayed carpal ossification. The findings in this family suggest autosomal-dominant inheritance of the condition. The clinical features are consistent with the condition currently referred to as \"distal\" arthrogryposis.",
