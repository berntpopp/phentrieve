  "full_text": "A 6 years old girl who was born to G3P2 30 years old mother following an uneventful pregnancy. She has been healthy, and her development is appropriate for age. She was found to have dislocated lenses and myopia that led to the identification of her condition. Her parents are nonconsanguineous, and there is no family history of a similar condition. On examination, her growth parameters at 6 years of age were weight 28.7 kg (>97th percentile), height 132 cm (>97th percentile) and head circumference 54 cm (on 97th percentile). She has a high arched palate, arachnodactyly, subluxated lenses and positive thumb and wrist signs. Echocardiogram revealed a doming of the mitral valve with minimal regurgitation.",
