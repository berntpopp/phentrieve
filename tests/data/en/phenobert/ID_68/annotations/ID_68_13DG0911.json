  "full_text": "A 25 years old female with psychomotor delay, brain malformation and epilepsy. She was born at full term via NSVD with a birth weight of 1.5 kg. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational DM treated with insulin. She did not cry immediately after birth and kept in NICU for 3 days. She also started to have seizures at the age of two years that are described as tonic clonic with rolling of the eyes. Her first EEG was normal, and subsequent EEGs showed multifocal discharges. Developmentally, she had a global developmental delay as she sat at the age of 2 years and started to walk after the age of 3 years. Her speech is significantly delayed. Her IQ was estimated to be 55, and she was enrolled in special education program. She was noted to have aggressive behavior that led to drug treatment. Her parents are nonconsanguineous, and their other children are healthy. Physical examination at 25 years of age was significant for short stature, obesity, hypertelorism and depressed nasal bridge and her growth parameters were weight 78 kg, height 140 cm and BMI 39.7. She has a normal tone and power with hyperreflexia in the lower limbs. Brain MRI revealed agenesis of corpus callosum with bilateral colpocephaly. The lumbosacral scan showed spina bifida at L5 as well as upper two sacral vertebrae. Abdominal and renal ultrasound showed right ectopic kidney lying in the pelvis close to the urinary bladder on the right side and mild bilateral hydronephrosis. Pelvic MRI was done for secondary amenorrhea and showed bicornuate unicollis uterus.",
