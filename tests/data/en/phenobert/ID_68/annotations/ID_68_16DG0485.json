  "full_text": "A 13 years old boy who was born at full term via NSVD following an uneventful pregnancy. He was developmentally normal until two years of age when he started to regress by losing his ability to speak. He sat with support at 4 months, talked by 9 months, and walked at 13 months. He is currently nonexpressive verbally, although he does seem to retain some verbal comprehension. He started to have seizures at 3 years of age. His seizures seem to be a combination of absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures which can occur even while he is walking and causing him to fall on the floor. He has an older sister who has been through the same course. His past medical history is noteworthy for a herniorrhaphy at age 4 months of age. His physical examination revealed appendicular hypertonia and hyporeflexia. He does not have dysmorphic features, and other examinations were within normal limits. His and his sister’s brain MRI were reported as normal. An experimental PET scan was done for him and it showed increased radiotracer binding in the bilateral basal ganglia and right hippocampus.",
