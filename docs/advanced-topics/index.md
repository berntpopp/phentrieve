# Advanced Topics

This section covers more in-depth aspects of Phentrieve for users who want to understand the system at a deeper level or customize it for specific use cases.

## Algorithms and Packages

Phentrieve leverages state-of-the-art algorithms from machine learning, NLP, and information retrieval. The [Algorithms and Packages](algorithms-and-packages.md) reference provides comprehensive documentation of all algorithms, key packages, methods, and functions used throughout the implementation, including embedding models, chunking algorithms, and retrieval techniques.

## Text Processing Pipeline

Phentrieve's text processing pipeline is highly configurable and can be adapted to different clinical text formats and languages. The [Text Processing Pipeline](text-processing-pipeline.md) page explains the internal architecture and customization options.

## Benchmarking Framework

To evaluate and compare different embedding models and configurations, Phentrieve includes a comprehensive benchmarking framework. The [Benchmarking Framework](benchmarking-framework.md) page explains how to run benchmarks and interpret the results.
