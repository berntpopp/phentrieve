# Phentrieve Logo

![Phentrieve Logo](../../frontend/public/hpo-logo.svg)

## Design Concept

The Phentrieve logo visualizes the concept of semantic similarity in a vector space. The stylized "P" serves as both the brand identifier and a functional representation of how Phentrieve works.

## Key Elements

- **Stylized P**: The letter "P" forms the core of the logo, with its counter (loop) serving as the origin point for vector operations.

- **Vector Rays**: Three vectors extend from the origin point:
  - Two closely angled vectors (bright blue) represent semantically similar terms
  - One vector at a wider angle (light blue) represents a dissimilar term

- **Data Nodes**: Circular nodes at vector endpoints represent HPO terms, with similar terms visually emphasized.

## Color Palette

- Primary Blue (#1867C0): Main "P" structure
- White (#FFFFFF): P's counter/origin point
- Active Blue (#42A5F5): Similar vectors and nodes
- Faded Blue (#90CAF9): Dissimilar vector and node

## Design Philosophy

The logo visually communicates Phentrieve's core functionality: identifying semantically similar HPO terms in a vector space. The minimalist design ensures clarity at various sizes while the vector representation elegantly illustrates the concept of semantic similarity.
