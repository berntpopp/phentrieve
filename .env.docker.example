# DOCKER DEPLOYMENT .env.docker settings
# ======================================
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to '.env.docker' in the same directory: `cp .env.docker.example .env.docker`
# 2. Edit '.env.docker' with your specific settings, especially PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR.
# 3. This file will be used by `docker-compose.yml` when you run Phentrieve services.

# --- Host Data & Cache Paths (CRITICAL) ---
# IMPORTANT: Set this to an ABSOLUTE path on your HOST machine where all persistent Phentrieve data will live.
# This includes HPO source files, generated indexes, translations, results, and model caches.
# The setup_phentrieve.sh script will attempt to create this directory and its subdirectories if they don't exist.
# Example (Linux/macOS): PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR=/srv/phentrieve/phentrieve_data
# Example (Windows using WSL, path inside WSL): PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR=/home/your_wsl_user/phentrieve_data
# Example (Windows using WSL, path on Windows C: drive): PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR=/mnt/c/phentrieve_data
PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR=

# Path on the HOST machine to store downloaded Hugging Face models (prevents re-downloads).
# It's recommended to keep this under your main PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR for organization.
# If left blank, the setup script and docker-compose will default it to a 'hf_cache' subdirectory
# within PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR (e.g., ${PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR}/hf_cache).
PHENTRIEVE_HOST_HF_CACHE_DIR=${PHENTRIEVE_HOST_DATA_DIR}/hf_cache


# --- Docker Network Configuration ---
# Name of the Docker network that Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) uses and Phentrieve services should connect to.
# If your NPM was started via docker-compose from a directory named 'npm', this is typically 'npm_default'.
# Verify with 'docker network ls' on your server if unsure.
# If you created a custom shared network, specify that name here.
NPM_SHARED_NETWORK_NAME=npm_default


# --- Public URLs (Replace with your actual domains) ---
# These are the URLs that will be configured in Nginx Proxy Manager and how users/frontend will access the services.
# VITE_API_URL_PUBLIC is used by the frontend's build process if it needs to know the absolute API URL.
VITE_FRONTEND_URL_PUBLIC=https://phentrieve.yourdomain.com
VITE_API_URL_PUBLIC=https://api.phentrieve.yourdomain.com/api/v1


# --- Application Settings ---
# Default model for the setup script to check for and build an index if missing.
DEFAULT_SETUP_INDEX_MODEL=FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023-M

# Logging level for the Phentrieve API service (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
LOG_LEVEL_API=INFO

# --- (Optional) Port Mappings for Direct Access (Local Development/Debug ONLY, NOT for NPM deployment) ---
# If you want to bypass NPM and access services directly on the host for debugging.
# Ensure these ports are free on your host machine if uncommented.
# The main docker-compose.yml would also need its 'ports' sections uncommented.
# API_PORT_HOST=8001
# FRONTEND_PORT_HOST=8080
